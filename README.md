## Technologies Used

HTML5 was employed to establish the structure of the gallery. HTML defines the essential components of the platform, such as the header, footer, navigation, and the sections displaying digital artworks. HTML forms the backbone of the site’s layout and ensures compatibility across different devices.

CSS3 was used to style the visual elements of the gallery. It ensures the gallery’s design is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. By utilizing CSS, the layout was made responsive, with media queries ensuring the gallery adapts seamlessly to a variety of screen sizes. Visual effects, such as hover transitions, artwork zooming, and fluid animations, were also implemented through CSS.

JavaScript  is a core technology for adding interactivity to the gallery. It enables features such as zooming into individual pieces of artwork, switching between different artworks in a seamless manner, and triggering pop-up information windows. JavaScript also handles user interactions, such as clicks and mouse movements, ensuring a smooth and dynamic browsing experience.

Font Awesome provides a library of vector icons used throughout the gallery for navigation and interaction. Icons such as arrows, magnifying glasses, and social media buttons help users easily navigate the gallery and engage with the content, while ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

Bootstrap is a front-end framework used for creating a responsive layout. With its built-in grid system and ready-made components, Bootstrap allows the gallery to adjust to various screen sizes, ensuring the content remains accessible and visually coherent on all devices. Bootstrap also facilitated the design of components like buttons, modals, and navigation bars, speeding up development and maintaining consistency in the gallery’s look and feel.
